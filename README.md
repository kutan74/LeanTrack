# LeanTrack
LeanTrack is a fitness app that allows you to record &amp; track your progress. Some of the features of LeanTrack
- Create your weekly workout schedule
- Apply most popular training techniques such as Reverse Pyramid Training, Strongman 5x5 and MYO reps
- Automatic linear weight increase each week
- Track your weekly, monthly progress
- Share your workout with your friends

# WHY LeanTrack
There are actually a lot of great apps to track your workout schedule like JEFIT, StrongLifts 5x5 but all them lacking the simplicity. They are forcing you to use their preset routines. It's problem if you are an experienced lifter. LeanTrack doesn't offer you fancy features.
